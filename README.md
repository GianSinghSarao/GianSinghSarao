## Skills and Abilities

The distinction between Skills and Abilities is that Skills connotate expertise, whereas Abilities are just things I can do.

### Tech Skills

I can write Markdown, HTML, and CSS. I can write JavaScript (for the browser and NodeJS). I can write batch files and shell scripts (for Windows and Linux, respectively).

### Tech Abilities

I can use Office programs such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc (Though I prefer their LibreOffice equivalents).

I know how to use search engines effectively to get good results quickly.

### Language Skills

English. I grew up reading, writing, listening, and speaking the language. I don't particularly want to prove it here - talk to me, and it'll become evident, no?

### Language Abilities

I have a formal qualification in French. But also, I haven't refreshed my French in a while. Regardless, my proficiency is at least equivalent to that of a primary school child in reading and writing.

Thanks to my mum, who often speaks Punjabi at home, I can understand it well, although I can't read or write in Punjabi.

At some point, I became interested in anime, So I started learning Japanese. I'm not even at the level of a pre-schooler (yet / at the time of writing this CV), but I am actively and consistently teaching myself Japanese using Duolingo.

## Other Experiences

### "Robotics" Club (Y8 - Y10 I think (I can't remember exactly))

I joined a computing club relatively early on, though before I knew it, it morphed into a robotics club. That said, "robotics" meant programmable LEGO, so I was disappointed that I couldn't use the Product Design lab to build a fully custom robot.

The new LEGO/Robotics club dedicated itself to winning the EV3 Space Challenge (<https://education.lego.com/en-us/lessons/ev3-space-challenge/>).

During the first year, someone had the idea to make a website. Since I had the best one early on, the website was mainly my responsibility.

The website didn't get much attention in subsequent years, but I stayed in the club and worked on programming the robot.
